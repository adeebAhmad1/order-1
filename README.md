1. Add a log each time the status changes in the comment section so it logs each time "Working on it" has been selected or any other status.
2. Need a free form field at the top below admin login button that only admin can edit/delete text for “today’s goals”. Employees should be able to see the text in the free form field but not edit/delete the text.
5. Add emoji widget to Comments(It would be great if we could add emoji and GIF to comments similar to monday.com)
6. Adding additional Boards similar to Monday.com(ONLY Admin should be able to add/edit and delete Additional Boards.)

Looks great BUT there are a few things that need to be fixed:
A. Today's Goals field should not be across all Boards. There should be a "Today's Goal" for each Board.
B. Please remove "Posted By Admin on 6:05:26 PM Fri Mar 27 2020" from Today's Goals field.(done)
C. When adding a emoji, it should add the emoji where the cursor is last and NOT at the bottom of the field.
D. Paragraph icon similar to monday.com is still missing.
E. Bold, italic, hyperlink,... icons needs to be smaller
F. Please add the Emoji icon on the left of the bold icon. (done)
G.Change the board text on the left from "Todos" to "Client Relations"
H.The emoji shortcut group sections are no longer there. Please make sure to put those back.
