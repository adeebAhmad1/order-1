BUG2: Time log does not get logged both time when “Working on it” status gets logged more than once. Example: Working on it, Stuck, Working on it, Done.
BUG3: When selecting a user for comments, drop down should appear when you click on gray image and not when you hover over mouse.
BUG4: After Admin logs in and tasks have been assigned, nothing should happen when Admin clicks on Team picture or Timeline UNLESS Cloning.

1. Same grid size and font size as Monday.com so it displays more tasks within a page without having to scroll down.
4. Status should be from top to bottom in this order: Not Started, Working on it, Stuck, Done.
5. All tasks and data should be grouped by Timeline Date and collapsed below to keep a log for reference. They should be sorted by most recent on the top to oldest date at the bottom. Most current date should always be expanded by default instead of collapsed. All previous Timeline dates should be collapsed and display Total Items and comments.
a.Also, collapse bar, should look exactly like monday.com.
c.There should be a small separation between each date.(margin)
f.Color of the collapse bar should be the same color as attachment.
g.Tasks column should be the same color as attachment.
h.White color around Team images should be same color as attachment.
i.White color around blue Timeline should be same color as attachment.
j.white color in Time Tracking column should be same color as attachment.

BUG5: ONLY when current status is “Working on it” “Working on it” time log, in comment has two colons::
BUG9: When employee click on comment, and keeps /admin_panel in URL it gives employee access to Admin page.
BUG10: Background image shows admin buttons for employees when adding a comment.
BUG6: Sometime when you click from Manage Tasks or Manage Team page “Go Back” button, all tasks turn Blue regardless of status name.Admin has to refresh for Status color to go back to normal. Same thing happens when Admin clicks on Sign Out button.
BUG13: When you click on a Task Status and then click on a different Task Status, it keeps the previous task status option open.
BUG7: Team images should be a bigger. There is a lot of space around the picture thatcould be used to maximize employee images.
BUG8: Mouse cursor should change when you hover with your mouse over envelope image and should say “Click here to mark comment unread” or “Click here to mark comment read”.
BUG11: When comment is added or when user clicks on the X, pop up should slide back and then exit.
BUG12: When Admin clicks on “Add Task” and the clicks on “Go Back” button, it should redirect to /admin_panel
6.“Clone” button should be modified to only clone within a Timeline Date and “Delete All” button should delete all tasks Regardless of Timeline date.
Cloning functionality needs to be updated so that previous employee image, Status, Comments, Timeline and Time Tracking NO LONGER get deleted.
When cloning, previous Timeline date and all its data get grouped collapsed bellow. When Admin enters the new single Timeline date that will apply to ALL “Timeline”, it will keeps all task names, puts gray default employee images for all the Team so admin can select each of them, RESET all comments, RESET all time tracking, and all new task status should be Not Started.
